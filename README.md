# Vision-Based OS-Level Automation Agent System

**Bl4ckGlass** is a modular AI-driven automation system designed to control any user interface web or desktop through pure visual input and simulated human behavior. It enables seamless automation of business workflows without relying on APIs, browser drivers, or internal integrations.

---

## End Goal

The final vision for **Bl4ckGlass** is a **local, AI-enhanced automation framework** that overlays on top of your OS like a second set of eyes and hands:

- **Visually detects** interface elements via OCR, template matching, or AI layout parsing.
- **Simulates human input** (mouse, keyboard, scrolling) with natural movement and randomization.
- **Works on any app**‚Äîweb, desktop, or hybrid, without requiring source access or developer APIs.
- **Acts modularly** through dedicated agents that understand login forms, search bars, upload dialogs, and buttons.
- **Mimics real behavior**, making it ideal for environments with anti-bot measures or undocumented interfaces.

---

## üéØ Ideal Use Cases

- Automating repetitive business workflows on SaaS platforms.
- Visual bots for job applications, form filling, or web scraping without APIs.
- GUI-based robotic process automation (RPA) on Linux.
- Agent-based simulation of user actions for testing or deployment pipelines.
- Legacy software automation where integration is otherwise impossible.

---

##  Architecture Overview

- **Orchestrator Agent** ‚Äì Manages workflow sequences (e.g., login ‚Üí search ‚Üí apply).
- **Vision Agent** ‚Äì Uses OCR + image recognition to detect fields and buttons.
- **Input Agent** ‚Äì Simulates clicks, typing, scrolling with PyAutoGUI.
- **Login Agent** ‚Äì Automates platform authentication visually.
- **Application Agent** ‚Äì Handles multi-step forms and file uploads.
- **Monitor Agent** ‚Äì Logs progress, handles timeouts, errors, and fallbacks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Technologies

- `PyAutoGUI` ‚Äì Mouse and keyboard control  
- `OpenCV` ‚Äì Template matching and screen parsing  
- `pytesseract` ‚Äì OCR for reading screen text  
- `Pillow` + `mss` ‚Äì Screen capture tools  
- `Xlib`, `x11` ‚Äì Full desktop compatibility (non-Wayland)

> ‚úÖ Must run on X11 (Ubuntu GUI).  
> ‚ùå Wayland not supported.

## üîß Example Use Case: Automating LinkedIn Job Applications

Included is a working prototype that launches a Chrome window, logs into LinkedIn, searches jobs, and finds the "Easy Apply" button all through visual AI and simulated input.

```bash
# Configure preferences
nano config.json

# Run the automation
python3 main.py
